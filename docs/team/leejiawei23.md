### Project: NUSConnect

NUSConnect - It helps NUS students efficiently organise and manage the contact details of peers they meet during
tutorials and group projects. It is designed for users who prefer a CLI. It allows for custom labeling, reminders, easy
updates, and is optimised for building and maintaining academic connections throughout their university journey.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**:
  * Created a mockup Ui of NUSConnect using figma
  * Added a new `view` command to show all details of a contact

* **Code contributed**:

  * Modified the Ui to match the mock Ui
  * Added PersonDetail and Group Ui classes

* **Testing**:
